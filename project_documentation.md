# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Introduction
This chapter introduces Bin-it, a Flutter-based waste management application that revolutionizes the connection between bin owners and recycling companies through smart technology and real-time monitoring.

## 1.2 Project Idea and Scope
Bin-it is a comprehensive waste management solution that enables bin owners to monitor their bins' fill levels in real-time and connect with recycling companies for efficient material collection and recycling. The scope encompasses user authentication, real-time monitoring, notifications, and a marketplace for recyclable materials.

## 1.3 Problem Definition
Traditional waste management faces several challenges:
- Inefficient bin monitoring leading to overflow or unnecessary collections
- Lack of direct communication between bin owners and recycling companies
- Manual tracking of recyclable materials
- Delayed response to bin maintenance needs

## 1.4 System Objectives
- Provide real-time bin level monitoring
- Facilitate direct connection between bin owners and recycling companies
- Automate the notification system for bin maintenance
- Create an efficient marketplace for recyclable materials
- Ensure secure and reliable data management

## 1.5 System Features
- Real-time bin level monitoring using Firebase Realtime Database
- Push notifications for level changes and updates
- Material selling marketplace
- Order management system
- User authentication and authorization
- Background service monitoring

## 1.6 Related Works
While there are existing waste management solutions, Bin-it differentiates itself through:
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Direct marketplace integration
- Multi-platform support (Android, iOS)
- Comprehensive notification system

## 1.7 System Requirements
### Technical Requirements
- Flutter Framework (Dart)
- Firebase Backend Services
- Real-time Database capabilities
- Push Notification support
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Hardware Requirements
- Smart bins with level sensors
- Mobile devices running Android or iOS
- Internet connectivity

## 1.8 System Users
The system serves two primary user types:
1. Bin Owners
   - Monitor bin levels
   - Create sell offers
   - Manage stock
   - Track orders

2. Recycling Companies
   - View available offers
   - Accept and manage orders
   - Track order progress

## 1.9 Methodology
The project follows a clean architecture pattern with:
1. Presentation Layer (UI components)
2. Business Logic Layer (Services, Controllers)
3. Data Layer (Models, Repositories)
